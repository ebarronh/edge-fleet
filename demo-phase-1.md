## Demo Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git repository cloned
- Terminal access

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start all services
./start-demo.sh

# 3. Wait for all services to start (30 seconds)
# Services will be available at:
# - Fleet Command: http://localhost:3000 (or 3002 if port conflict)
# - Vessel Apps: http://localhost:3001, 3002, 3003
# - WebSocket Server: http://localhost:3999
```

### Verify Setup
Open browser tabs for:
- **Fleet Command**: `http://localhost:3002` (primary demo interface)
- **Vessel 1**: `http://localhost:3001` (MV Pacific Explorer)
- **Vessel 2**: `http://localhost:3002` (SS Northern Star)  
- **Vessel 3**: `http://localhost:3003` (MV Coastal Pioneer)

## Demo Script (15-20 minutes)

### **Phase 1: Introduction & Online Operations** (3 minutes)

**What to Show:**
1. **Fleet Command Dashboard**
   - Open Fleet Command at `http://localhost:3002`
   - Point out the professional maritime design theme
   - Show fleet statistics: "3 Active Vessels, 0 Offline, 3 Total Fleet"
   - Highlight vessel list showing all 3 vessels as active

2. **Vessel Bridge Interface**
   - Open Vessel 1 at `http://localhost:3001`
   - Showcase the bridge dashboard with maritime gauges
   - Point out real-time data: engine RPM, speed, heading, fuel consumption
   - Show the "ONLINE" connection indicator

**What to Say:**
> "This is EdgeFleet, an offline-first maritime operations platform. We have 3 vessels operating along West Coast shipping routes. Notice the professional maritime design - this isn't just functional, it's built for real maritime operations. Each vessel runs independently and can operate completely offline while maintaining full functionality."

### **Phase 2: Offline Transition Demo** (5 minutes)

**What to Show:**
1. **Simulate Network Disconnection**
   - In Vessel 1 interface, click the "ONLINE" toggle in the header
   - Show immediate visual changes:
     - Status changes to "OFFLINE MODE" 
     - Red banner appears
     - Sync queue counter appears

2. **Demonstrate Offline Operations**
   - Show vessel continues operating normally
   - Point out position updates still happening
   - Engine gauges still updating with sensor data
   - Navigation and fuel consumption tracking continues

3. **Fleet Command Perspective**
   - Switch to Fleet Command tab
   - Show vessel now appears as "offline" in the status
   - Demonstrate that vessel still visible but marked as disconnected

**What to Say:**
> "Now I'm simulating a network disconnection - this could be going through a tunnel, underwater operations, or remote ocean areas with no connectivity. Notice the vessel doesn't stop working. It's completely autonomous, continuing to collect sensor data, track position, and maintain operations. All data is stored locally using IndexedDB."

### **Phase 3: Data Accumulation** (3 minutes)

**What to Show:**
1. **Watch Data Accumulate**
   - Stay on Vessel 1 for 2-3 minutes
   - Point out position updates continuing every 5 seconds
   - Show sensor data changing (RPM, fuel, temperature)
   - Highlight sync queue counter increasing

2. **Show Local Storage Working**
   - Open browser dev tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage tab
   - Show IndexedDB with EdgeFleetDB database
   - Browse through tables showing accumulated data

**What to Say:**
> "The vessel is now operating in pure edge computing mode. It's accumulating position updates, sensor readings, and operational data every 5 seconds. This is all stored locally in the browser's IndexedDB - no cloud dependency. In a real maritime scenario, this could continue for hours or days."

### **Phase 4: Sync Verification** (4 minutes)

**What to Show:**
1. **Access Sync Verification**
   - Go to Fleet Command interface
   - Click "Verify Sync" button in the header
   - Show the Sync Verification modal opening

2. **Demonstrate Data Analysis**
   - Point out Local Storage section showing accumulated data
   - Show Cloud Storage section (simulated)
   - Highlight compression metrics and bandwidth savings
   - Explain cost savings calculations

**What to Say:**
> "This is our sync verification dashboard. It compares local data with cloud data and shows the efficiency gains from edge computing. Notice the data compression - we're reducing bandwidth by 75% and saving significant costs by processing data locally first."

### **Phase 5: Return Online & Sync** (3 minutes)

**What to Show:**
1. **Reconnect to Network**
   - Return to Vessel 1 interface
   - Click the "OFFLINE" toggle to go back online
   - Show status changing to "SYNCING"
   - Watch sync queue counter decrease

2. **Demonstrate Sync Process**
   - Show animated sync progress
   - Point out bandwidth savings display
   - Show status return to "ONLINE" with "All synced" message

3. **Verify Fleet Command Update**
   - Switch to Fleet Command
   - Show vessel status updated to "active"
   - Refresh sync verification to show updated cloud data

**What to Say:**
> "Now we're reconnecting to the network. Watch the sync process - it's intelligent, compressing and batching data for efficient transmission. In just seconds, all the data collected during offline operation is synchronized to the cloud. This is the power of edge computing in maritime operations."

### **Phase 6: Closing & Benefits** (2 minutes)

**What to Show:**
1. **Final Verification**
   - Open sync verification one more time
   - Show matching local and cloud data
   - Highlight total bandwidth and cost savings

2. **Multiple Vessel Operations**
   - Quickly show other vessel interfaces
   - Demonstrate each has independent operation
   - Show different shipping routes and vessel types

**What to Say:**
> "EdgeFleet demonstrates how edge computing transforms maritime operations. Vessels operate independently, reduce bandwidth costs by 75%, and maintain full functionality regardless of connectivity. This is critical for remote ocean operations, port security, and fleet management efficiency."

pkill -f "vite"
pkill -f "node"

# Restart
./start-demo.sh
```
