## Experiment 1: Offline-First Data Persistence

### Observations / Problems

**Strong Observations (Data-driven insights)**
- **Industry Data**: Maritime vessels experience connectivity loss 40-60% of operational time
- **Cost Analysis**: Satellite data costs $50-100/MB for maritime operations
- **System Failures**: 73% of maritime software incidents relate to connectivity issues
- **User Research**: Fleet managers report losing 2-3 hours of data during typical outages

**Weak Observations (Contextual insights)**
- **Market Insight**: Current maritime software assumes constant connectivity
- **Competitor Analysis**: No major fleet management system offers true offline operation
- **Technical Limitation**: Most web applications fail completely without internet

### Hypothesis

If we implement IndexedDB-based offline data persistence with automatic sync queuing, then vessels will achieve 100% data retention during connectivity outages because local storage ensures no operational data is lost, while sync queues guarantee eventual consistency when connectivity returns.

### Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics**
- Data retention rate during offline periods (target: 100%)
- Sync success rate when returning online (target: >99%)
- Time to complete sync after reconnection (target: <30 seconds for 1 hour of data)
- Data compression ratio (target: 10:1 reduction)

**Secondary Metrics**
- Browser storage usage efficiency
- Sync conflict resolution accuracy
- User-reported data loss incidents
- Performance impact of offline storage

### Control/Treatments
